SuCo (but not shit)
    discord.py (runner class)
        - output to discord bot
        - pulls inputs from discord and calls functions from lol_riot.py and val_riot.py

        LOL:
            "!help"
                help page embed
            "![summoner info]"
                creates League object of said summoner (switches over only when this specific function is used again)
                embed containing ign, profile icon, and information from the summoner_info class
            "![champion mastery]"
                embed containing information from champion mastery function
                maybe i should have a mass list that shows all the champions in the users possession pop up and then a command to index a particular champion
                    "oh heres a list of champions, please punch in the number you'd like stats for"
                icons of art for each champion


    lol_riot.py
        - lol_riot object
            - creates instances of players using inputs from discord.py
            - retrieves information using rgapi and riotwatcher api (lolwatcher)
